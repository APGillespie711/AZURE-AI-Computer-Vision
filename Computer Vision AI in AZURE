# A short AI computing project to demonstrate AI skills when working in AZURE. 

I wanted to explore how AZURE can handle AI to analyze video, either live stream or pre recorded to help with things such as safety control, accident responce and stock taking within a shop. 

The entire process was captured through screen shots, in which each step of the process and the results and implications for real world tasks to assist in various working environments.
